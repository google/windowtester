						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						1.1 Your use of Google's products, software, services 
						and web sites (referred to collectively as the 
						&quot;Services&quot; in this document and excluding any services 
						provided to you by Google under a separate written 
						agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement 
						between you and Google. &quot;Google&quot; means Google Inc., 
						whose principal place of business is at 1600 
						Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United 
						States. This document explains how the agreement is made 
						up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your 
						agreement with Google will always include, at a minimum, 
						the terms and conditions set out in this document. These 
						are referred to below as the &quot;Universal Terms&quot;.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						1.3 Your agreement with Google will also include the 
						terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, 
						in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are 
						referred to below as the &quot;Additional Terms&quot;. Where 
						Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be 
						accessible for you to read either within, or through 
						your use of, that Service.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional 
						Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and 
						Google in relation to your use of the Services. It is 
						important that you take the time to read them carefully. 
						Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below 
						as the &quot;Terms&quot;.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the

							<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
							(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, 
							you understand and agree that Google will treat your 
							use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from 
							that point onwards.</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the

						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						4.1 Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal

						you.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">

						acknowledge and agree that Google may stop (permanently 
						or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features 
						within the Services) to you or to users generally at 
						Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. 
						You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not 
						need to specifically inform Google when you stop using 
						the Services.</p>

						4.4 You acknowledge and agree that if Google disables 
						access to your account, you may be prevented from 
						accessing the Services, your account details or any 
						files or other content which is contained in your 
						account.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						4.5 You acknowledge and agree that while Google may not 
						currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of 
						transmissions you may send or receive through the 
						Services or on the amount of storage space used for the 
						provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be 
						set by Google at any time, at Google's discretion.</p>

						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						20.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a 
						result of, or through your use of the Services) use a 
						service or download a piece of software, or purchase 
						goods, which are provided by another person or company. 
						Your use of these other services, software or goods may 
						be subject to separate terms between you and the company 
						or person concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your 
						legal relationship with these other companies or 
						individuals.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						20.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement 
						between you and Google and govern your use of the 
						Services (but excluding any services which Google may 
						provide to you under a separate written agreement), and 
						completely replace any prior agreements between you and 
						Google in relation to the Services.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						20.3 You agree that Google may provide you with notices, 
						including those regarding changes to the Terms, by 
						email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						20.4 You agree that if Google does not exercise or 
						enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in 
						the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any 
						applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal 
						waiver of Google's rights and that those rights or 
						remedies will still be available to Google.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						20.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to 
						decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these 
						Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed 
						from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. 
						The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to 
						be valid and enforceable.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						20.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the 
						group of companies of which Google is the parent shall 
						be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such 
						other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, 
						and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers 
						a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than 
						this, no other person or company shall be third party 
						beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
						<p style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; ">
						20.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Google under 
						the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of 
						California without regard to its conflict of laws 
						provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the 
						exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the 
						county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal 
						matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you 
						agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for 
						injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent 
						legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
